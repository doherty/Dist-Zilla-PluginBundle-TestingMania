NAME
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::TestingMania - test your dist with every
    testing plugin conceivable

VERSION
    version v0.13

SYNOPSIS
    In dist.ini:

        [@TestingMania]

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin bundle collects all the testing plugins for Dist::Zilla
    which exist (and are not deprecated). This is for the most paranoid
    people who want to test their dist seven ways to Sunday.

    Simply add the following near the end of dist.ini:

        [@TestingMania]

  Testing plugins
    *   Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::Compile, which performs tests to syntax
        check your dist.

    *   Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::Perl::Critic, which checks your code
        against best practices. See Test::Perl::Critic and Perl::Critic for
        details.

        You can set a perlcritic config file:

            [@TestingMania]
            critic_config = perlcriticrc

    *   Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::DistManifest, which tests MANIFEST for
        correctness. See Test::DistManifest for details.

    *   Dist::Zilla::Plugin::EOLTests, which ensures the correct line
        endings are used (and also checks for trailing whitespace). See
        Test::EOL for details.

    *   Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::Version, which tests that your dist has
        version numbers, and that they are valid. See Test::Version for
        exactly what that means.

    *   Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::Kwalitee, which performs some basic
        kwalitee checks. *Kwalitee* is an automatically-measurable guage of
        how good your software is. It bears only a superficial resemblance
        to the human-measurable guage of actual quality. See Test::Kwalitee
        for a description of the tests.

    *   Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MetaTests, which performs some extra tests on
        META.yml. See Test::CPAN::Meta for what that means.

    *   Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::CPAN::Meta::JSON, which performs some
        extra tests on META.json, if it exists. See Test::CPAN::Meta::JSON
        for what that means.

    *   Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::MinimumVersion, which tests for the
        minimum required version of perl. See Test::MinimumVersion for
        details, including limitations.

    *   Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MojibakeTests, which tests for the correct
        source/documentation character encoding.

    *   Dist::Zilla::Plugin::NoTabsTests, which ensures you don't use *The
        Evil Character*. See Test::NoTabs for details. If you wish to
        exclude this plugin, see "Disabling Tests".

    *   Dist::Zilla::Plugin::PodCoverageTests, which checks that you have
        Pod documentation for the things you should have it for. See
        Test::Pod::Coverage for what that means.

    *   Dist::Zilla::Plugin::PodSyntaxTests, which checks that your Pod is
        well-formed. See Test::Pod and perlpod for details.

    *   Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::Portability, which performs some basic
        tests to ensure portability of file names. See
        Test::Portability::Files for what that means.

    *   Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::Synopsis, which does syntax checking on
        the code from your SYNOPSIS section. See Test::Synopsis for details
        and limitations.

    *   Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::UnusedVars, which checks your dist for
        unused variables. See Test::Vars for details.

    *   Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::Pod::LinkCheck, which checks the links in
        your POD. See Test::Pod::LinkCheck for details.

    *   Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::CPAN::Changes, which checks your
        changelog for conformance with CPAN::Changes::Spec. See
        Test::CPAN::Changes for details.

        Set "changelog" in dist.ini if you don't use Changes:

            [@TestingMania]
            changelog = CHANGELOG

  Disabling Tests
    To exclude a testing plugin, give a comma-separated list in dist.ini:

        [@TestingMania]
        disable = Test::DistManifest,Test::Kwalitee

  Enabling Tests
    This pluginbundle may have some testing plugins that aren't enabled by
    default. This option allows you to turn them on. Attempting to add
    plugins which are not listed above will have *no effect*.

    To enable a testing plugin, give a comma-separated list in dist.ini:

        [@TestingMania]
        enable = Test::Compile
