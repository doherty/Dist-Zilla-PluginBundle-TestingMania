NAME
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::TestingMania - test your dist with every
    testing plugin conceivable

VERSION
    version 0.006

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin bundle collects all the testing plugins for Dist::Zilla
    which exist (and are not deprecated). This is for the most paranoid
    people who want to test their dist seven ways to Sunday.

    Simply add the following near the end of dist.ini:

        [@TestingMania]

    It includes the most recent version (as of release time) of the
    following plugins, in their default configuration. Note that not all the
    plugins are actually *used* by default.

  Testing plugins
    *   Dist::Zilla::Plugin::CheckChangesTests, which checks your Changes
        file for correctness. See Test::CheckChanges for what that means.
        This is not enabled by default; see "Adding Tests".

    *   Dist::Zilla::Plugin::CompileTests, which performs tests to syntax
        check your dist.

    *   Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ConsistentVersionTest, which tests that all
        modules in the dist have the same version. See
        Test::ConsistentVersion for details. This is not enabled by default;
        see "Adding Tests".

    *   Dist::Zilla::Plugin::CriticTests, which checks your code against
        best practices. See Perl::Critic for details.

    *   Dist::Zilla::Plugin::DistManifestTests, which tests MANIFEST for
        correctness. See Test::DistManifest for details.

    *   Dist::Zilla::Plugin::EOLTests, which ensures the correct line
        endings are used (and also checks for trailing whitespace). See
        Test::EOL for details.

    *   Dist::Zilla::Plugin::HasVersionTests, which tests that your dist has
        version numbers. See Test::HasVersion for what that means.

    *   Dist::Zilla::Plugin::KwaliteeTests, which performs some basic
        kwalitee checks. *Kwalitee* is an automatically-measurable guage of
        how good your software is. It bears only a superficial resemblance
        to the human-measurable guage of actual quality. See Test::Kwalitee
        for a description of the tests.

    *   Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MetaTests, which performs some extra tests on
        META.yml. See Test::CPAN::Meta for what that means.

    *   Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MinimumVersionTests, which tests for the
        minimum required version of perl. See Test::MinimumVersion for
        details, including limitations.

    *   Dist::Zilla::Plugin::NoTabsTests, which ensures you don't use *The
        Evil Character*. See Test::NoTabs for details. If you wish to
        exclude this plugin, see "Excluding Tests".

    *   Dist::Zilla::Plugin::PodCoverageTests, which checks that you have
        Pod documentation for the things you should have it for. See
        Test::Pod::Coverage for what that means.

    *   Dist::Zilla::Plugin::PodSyntaxTests, which checks that your Pod is
        well-formed. See Test::Pod and perlpod for details.

    *   Dist::Zilla::Plugin::PortabilityTests, which performs some basic
        tests to ensure portability of file names. See
        Test::Portability::Files for what that means.

    *   Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ProgCriticTests, which helps developers by
        gradually enforcing coding standards. See
        Test::Perl::Critic::Progressive for what that means. This is not
        enabled by default; see "Adding Tests".

    *   Dist::Zilla::Plugin::SynopsisTests, which does syntax checking on
        the code from your SYNOPSIS section. See Test::Synopsis for details
        and limitations.

    *   Dist::Zilla::Plugin::UnusedVarsTests, which checks your dist for
        unused variables. See Test::Vars for details.

    *   Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ChangesTests, which checks your changelog for
        conformance with CPAN::Changes::Spec. See Test::CPAN::Changes for
        details.

  Excluding Tests
    To exclude a testing plugin, give a comma-separated list in dist.ini:

        [@TestingMania]
        skip = EOLTests,NoTabsTests

  Adding Tests
    To add a testing plugin which is listed above, but not enabled by
    default, give a comma-separated list in dist.ini:

        [@TestingMania]
        add = ApacheTest,PodSpellingTests

    Attempting to add plugins which are not listed above will have no
    effect.
